## CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES
In the event that the minimum voting age in the United States changes, anyone is welcome to create a pull request that corrects the check.
Perhaps you would also like to support checking against the minimum voting age of a *different* country. You are welcome to do that as well. Surprise us.

The project is contained within a Jupyter Notebook. You will need software capable of editing (and rendering) one. Or, if you are feeling daring, you can edit the raw file in something like Notepad. We expect that all code has been tested and edge-cases accounted for. All you need to really do is fork and get to making changes :)
